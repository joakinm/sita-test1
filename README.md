SITA Test

A lightweight project demonstrating one test and a "licence plate" simulator, implemented in separate files.

File 1: a test written for test a function who fetch an urls array,  not requesting more than MAX_CONCURRENC_URLs

File 2: a license plate simulator of 6 digits based on numbers with max in ZZZZZZ. For example: if you put 26**5 * 10 (118.813.760), it prints: "0JXBLW"
